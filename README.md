# Windows shellcode emulation tool based upon [unicorn framework](https://www.unicorn-engine.org/).

ShellcodeEmulator emulates shellcode with the help of windbg process memory dumps. You can provide process memory dump as a input with shellcode to analyze, it will emulate as much as the userland layer just above kernel calls. You can add your custom syscall handlers or any handlers in between the API calls used by shellcode and the kernel layer.

## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ohjeongwook/ShellcodeEmulator --upgrade
```

## Usage

```
> python -m shellcode_emulator.run

Usage: run.py [options] args

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b IMAGE_BASE, --image_base=IMAGE_BASE
                        Image base to load the shellcode inside process memory
  -d DUMP_FILENAME, --dump_filename=DUMP_FILENAME
                        A process dump file from normal Windows process
  -l LIST_FILENAME, --list_filename=LIST_FILENAME
                        A list filename generated by IDA (this can be used
                        instead of shellcode filename)
```

### Example

1. Take process dump from Windows notepad process using Process Explorer and save it as notepad.dmp
2. Run wincalc.bin shellcode

```
python -m shellcode_emulator.run wincalc.bin -d notepad.dmp
```
